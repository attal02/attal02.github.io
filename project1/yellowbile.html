            <br><br>Prometheus, a figure from Greek mythology, is often associated with qualities and actions that can be linked to a choleric temperament in the context of humorism.

            Prometheus is renowned for his act of defiance against the gods by stealing fire from Olympus and giving it to humanity. This act of rebellion and defiance aligns with the choleric temperament's characteristics of assertiveness and a tendency to challenge the status quo.
            
            Prometheus exhibited great courage and boldness in his actions. He was willing to face the wrath of the gods to benefit humanity. These traits align with the choleric temperament's characteristic of willingness to take risks.
