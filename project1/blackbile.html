        <p style="margin-left: 770px; margin-top: 60px; width: 640px;">The concept of black bile historically connects to the emotion of apathy. It was thought that the imbalance of black bile was what fueled melancholia.

            <br><br>'Melancholia is the happiness of being sad', said Victor Hugo. Indeed, whether or not melancholia is productive is up to the individual, however, it must be said that the greater the consciousness, the greater the despair.
            <br>Thus it is that despair, this sickness in the self, is the sickness unto death.

            <br><br>It was during Shakespeare's era in which those who were melancholic were diagnosed with the imbalance of black bile, and traits such as moodiness, malaise, pessimism, gloom, and introspection were attributed to this imbalance.

            <br><br>Black bile is associated with the element earth and has the qualities of cold and dry. It represents grief and mourning.

        <h2 style="font-size: 30px; color:white; margin-left: 40px; margin-top: -10px;">I saw the beginning of the end, the exhaustion that gazes backwards,
            <br>announcing itself with it's own mincing melancholy.
