        <h2 style="position:absolute; color:#FF003D; font-size: 30px; margin-top: -780px; margin-left: 920px">Sanguine Courage</h2>
        <p style="color:white; position: absolute; padding: 0; margin-top: -700px; margin-left: 800px; width: 600px;">Sanguine individuals were believed to have an excess of blood, which was associated with a warm and moist temperament. This excess was thought to make them cheerful, optimistic, and passionate. From a philosophical perspective, this temperament was often associated with a positive outlook on life and an appreciation for the joys and pleasures of existence. <br><br>Philosophers may consider the sanguine temperament as an example of how one's bodily constitution can influence their worldview.
        
        <br><br>The sanguine temperament was considered to be extroverted, sociable, and enthusiastic. Philosophers interested in character and personality could explore the idea of how one's physical makeup, in this case, the balance of humors, can influence the development of their character. <br><br>They may ponder the question of how inherent traits interact with environmental factors to shape an individual's personality.</p></section>
