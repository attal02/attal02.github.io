        <p style="margin-left: 47%; padding-top: 0%; width: 700px;">

            The four humors, also known as the four humours or four temperaments, is an ancient medical concept that dates back to the time of the Greek physician Hippocrates (460-370 BCE) and was later developed by other ancient medical practitioners such as Galen. This theory was influential in Western medicine for over 2,000 years. The four humors were believed to be bodily fluids that influenced a person's temperament and health. They were associated with the four elements (earth, water, air, and fire) and had specific qualities.
            <br><br>The theory of the four humors was used to diagnose and treat illness, and it also influenced ideas about personality and behavior. In this system, good health was believed to result from a balance of the four humors, while illness and disease were attributed to imbalances. Treatments often involved various methods to restore this balance, such as dietary changes, bloodletting, and herbal remedies.

            <br><br>It's important to note that this theory has long been discredited and is not a part of modern medical practice. Contemporary medicine is based on scientific principles and evidence-based practices, and the concept of the four humors is considered a historical relic.</p>

        <p style= "padding-left: 3%; padding-top: 0%;">In the theory of the four humors, each humor was associated with a particular season and section of the body. These associations were used to explain various personality traits and health conditions.
            <br><br>Blood (Sanguine) was associated with the springtime. <br>The blood was associated with the heart and was believed to be produced in the liver. It was thought to flow throughout the body via the circulatory system.
            <br><br>Phlegm (Phlegmatic) was associated with winter. <br>Phlegm was associated with the brain and the head. It was believed to be produced in the brain and could accumulate in the sinuses, leading to conditions such as colds and congestion.
            <br><br>Yellow Bile (Choleric) was associated with summer. <br>Yellow bile was associated with the liver and the gallbladder. It was thought to be responsible for the digestion of fats and could cause digestive disorders when imbalanced.
            <br><br>Black Bile (Melancholic) was associated with autumn. <br>Black bile was associated with the spleen and the lower abdomen. It was believed to be involved in the processes of digestion and absorption in the intestines. An imbalance of black bile was thought to lead to melancholic tendencies and digestive issues.
